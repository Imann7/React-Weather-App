The React Weather App is a web application that allows you to check the current weather conditions in any city around the world. It is built using React.js and the OpenWeather API.

When you launch the app, you will see a search bar where you can input the name of any city to get its current weather conditions. You will be presented with the current temperature, real feel, and a brief description of the weather.

The app is designed to be easy to use and provides accurate weather information for any city you search.
